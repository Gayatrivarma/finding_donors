    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we are classifing the data i.e, we are dividing the data based on the income ( greater than 50K and less than 50K).\n",
    "As all the above mentioned methods are used to solve classification problems, some of them may work efficiently some may not.\n",
    "So we need to select a model such that it predicts accurately.\n",
    "I choosed the following three algorithms:\n",
    "- Random forest\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine\n",
    "- Ada Boost.\n",
    "I think that these three algorithms may work more accurately and efficiently.\n",
    "##### Random Forest\n",
    "Random forest classifier is one of the ensemble methods(where they improve results by combining models). \n",
    "Random forest can apply to both classification and regression.In random forest the original dataset is divided into subsets randomly and for each subset a decision tree is constructed , so many decision tree are constructed where each provides a classification.Out of all majority classifiaction is finally considered.If there are more decision trees then more accurate the model is.\n",
    "- `Application` : Random forest can be applied to many sectors like banking,medicine,e-commerce etc.In medical field using random forest we can identify the correct combination of components in medicine and how well they can cure the disease.\n",
    "- `Strengths` : It can applied for both classification and regression.It handles missing values and  also it can handle large data. It is robust to overfitting.It is more accurate for classification rather than regression.\n",
    "- `Weaknesses` : It takes a lot of memory because of more and large decision trees.It may overfit due to noisy.It gives better results for classification but not for regression.In case of regression it may overfit the data and is restricted to given data and cannot work beyond the data.So it works poorly for regression. \n",
    " - `references` : https://recast.ai/blog/machine-learning-algorithms/2/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_2LkhMJcfY&t=157s\n",
    " -https://medium.com/@Synced/how-random-forest-algorithm-works-in-machine-learning-3c0fe15b6674\n",
    "- In this problem we are going to find donors i.e, salary greater than 50K are likely to donate and less than are not,So here we are finding whose salary is greater and lesser than 50K.We can find this using all other features ,so building random forests on different subsets of the data we can classify the data accurately.\n",
    "##### Support Vector Machine\n",
    "Support Vector machine also used in both classification and regression.It can also be reffered as hyperplane.SVM seperates the given classes.It can categorize any number of classes.It seperates the two classes which is hyperplane by maximizing the distance between support vectors which are points at the boundaries which seperates the classes.It tries to maximize the distance because very close plane may cause misclassification.\n",
    "- `Application` : SVM can be widely used for classification problems. we can use this for image classification as it classifies more accurately.It can also be used in fraud detection or spam detection.\n",
    "- `Strengths` : It is robust to overfitting as it is maximizing the distance.It is fast and can generally apply to large data. Unlike linear regression it is not restricted to only linear relations.It can apply to all types because of having kernals.It works better for large data also becuase it doesn't consider all the training data ,i.e, it mainly seperates using support vectors.\n",
    "- `Weakenesses` : It may give wrong predictions when the data is noisy.When the data is large it takes more time to train.It is less effective for overlapping classes.\n",
    "  - `Rerences` : https://recast.ai/blog/machine-learning-algorithms/2/   https://medium.com/machine-learning-101/chapter-2-svm-support-vector-machine-theory-f0812effc72\n",
    "- As this problem is a classification problem svm can work more accurately and can categorize it better.we can classify by making the distance maximum so that we can avoid overfitting.\n",
    "##### Ada Boost\n",
    "Adaboost(Adaptive boosting) is one of the boosting techniques.Boosting creates strong learners using weak learners.AdaBoost is one of this type where every time it creates a new learner from the past weak learners.In AdaBoost generally we use decision stamps.A decision stamp is referred as a decision tree at each level.By doing the same process repeatedly we can obtain a strong learner.\n",
    "- `Application` : One of the applications adaboost used is face recongnition. We can classify images and can identify whether the image has a face or not.\n",
    "- `Strengths` : As it is learned from weak learners it can give more accurate results.It is more accurate when it is binary classification.\n",
    "- `Weaknesses`: More and more decision stamps increase the memory and also increases performance time.\n",
    "  - `References` : https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/05/boosting-algorithms-simplified/  https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-ensemble-of-learners-adaboost/\n",
    "- In this project we can bulid decision stamps from the features and can predict accurately.Every time we create a decision stump the accuracy will be increased so that at the finding a best predictor.\n"

    "AdaBoost Classifier creates strong learner using weak learners.Once the testing and training set is divided.Decisions stumps are created.These decision stumps are also called as one-level decision trees and here they are considered as weak learners. A weak learner is defined to be a classifier that is only slightly correlated with the true classification (it can label examples better than random guessing).The intuition here is that a strong learner is capable of extracting an arbitrary amount of signal from data, whereas a weak learner is only capable of extracting a little bit of signal, i.e, as we are taking only one-level decision tree,so they are taken as weak learners.At first it gives equal weight to each observation, if the prediction is incorrect it changes the sample weight according to the prediction and again another classification, this sequence of steps are continued untill we reach a best prediction.So every time a weak learner is modified by changing samples and weights so that producing a new learner.Again it is checked and the process is repeated."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
